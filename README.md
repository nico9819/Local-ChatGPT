# LocalChatGPT

LocalChatGPT is a web application that utilizes local storage to implement a chat interface powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model. This application allows users to engage in conversations with the chatbot without the need for a server or external database. All user interactions and chat history are stored locally within the user's web browser.
